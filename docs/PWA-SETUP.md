### service-worker.js
- **Cache Strategy**: Cache-first for assets, Network-first for API
- **Offline Fallback**: Graceful degradation when offline

## 🎯 Features in Detail

### 1. Offline Support
The Service Worker caches:
- All HTML pages
- Stylesheets and scripts
- Static assets
- Recent API responses

When offline, the app serves cached content automatically.

### 2. Install Prompt
- Shows after 3 seconds of page load
- Can be dismissed with "Later" button
- Won't show again if already installed

### 3. Shortcuts
Users can long-press app icon (Android) or use Siri Shortcuts (iOS) to:
- Go to Dashboard
- Create new campaign
- View Rewards

### 4. Notifications
When app is installed, users receive notifications for:
- Proof approval/rejection
- New reward opportunities
- Campaign updates

## 📦 Required Icons

For full PWA support, you need these icons in `/public/images/`:
- `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 PNG
- `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 PNG
- `icon-maskable-192x192.png` - Maskable 192x192 PNG (for adaptive icons)
- `icon-maskable-512x512.png` - Maskable 512x512 PNG
- `apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180 PNG for iOS

**Placeholder icons are ready** - Replace with proper app logo in production.

Requirements:
- ✅ HTTPS (required for production)
- ✅ Valid manifest.json
- ✅ Service Worker registered
- ✅ Installable with home screen icon
- ✅ Offline support

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Before Launch
1. **Generate proper icons** (192x192 and 512x512 PNG)
2. **Add HTTPS** (PWA requires HTTPS in production)
3. **Update manifest colors** to match brand
4. **Test on real devices** (iOS and Android)
5. **Monitor Service Worker** updates

### Security
- All external resources should be HTTPS
- Content Security Policy headers recommended
- Regular security audits for offline cache

### Performance
- Keep cache size reasonable (aim for < 5MB)
- Implement cache versioning strategy
- Monitor network requests in production

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### App not installing
- Check manifest.json is valid (use https://www.pwabuilder.com/)
- Ensure HTTPS in production
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Service Worker not working
- Check browser console for errors
- Correct SW path in production is `/service-worker.js` (NOT `/public/service-worker.js` — the `/public/` prefix does not exist after Vite builds to `dist/`)
- Unregister and re-register in DevTools → Application → Service Workers

### Notifications not showing
- Check browser permissions
- Ensure backend push service is configured
- Test with simple notification first

### Cache not updating
- Service Worker caches on first load
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to force update
- Use cache versioning for updates

## 📝 Known Issues & Next Steps

### Known Issues (see ROADMAP.md Bug Backlog)
- `src/services/pwa.js` registers the wrong SW path (`/public/service-worker.js`) — fix to `/service-worker.js`
- `initializePWA()` is exported but never called by any page script — install banner and notification permission request are dead code
- `src/scripts/auth-validation.js` also registers the SW (correct path `/service-worker.js`) as a module side-effect — two competing registrations exist; one silently fails. SW registration should live in one place only.
- Install banner strings are hardcoded English — need `t()` i18n

### Next Steps
1. Generate production-quality icons (replace placeholders in `/public/images/`)
2. Wire `initializePWA()` into the main page scripts (currently unused)
3. Fix SW path in `pwa.js` — change to `/service-worker.js`
4. Implement background sync for offline form submissions
5. Monitor cache size in production — aim for < 5MB total
